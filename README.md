### ParkWhale ###
An app to serve your Vancouver street parking needs.

Created by Team 1000 Whaling Corpses as an academic project for CPSC310. 
Team members: Hoi Ting (Ting Ting) Tai, Kieran Collery, Daniel Hill, and Anthony Campbell. 

This app was built using Django and a good deal of JavaScript focused around the Google Maps API. Our team followed the scrum process with our lab teaching assistant acting as our Scrum Master. Features were split into 2 sprints, with the submitted project completed on April 2, 2015.
